# ðŸ”´ Status Sync

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that lets you set and sync your real-time status on Slack, GitHub, and other places.

## ðŸŒŸ How it works

Several services let you set a live status (e.g., "working", "AKF", etc.), such as Slack and GitHub. Instead of manually setting and updating your status on each service, you can use this repository as a template to set up an automation to do this for you. It also exposes a JSON API, so you can show your status in other places, such as your website, in real time.

### Supported services
